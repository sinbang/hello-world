# hello-world

I'm trying to learn programming using online resources only, partially because I'm currently in China, but also because the idea of learning something new without having to pay out the ass is becoming more and more novel in this world.
I've been in a shitty mood lately that shows no signs of waning.
The air is poison
The water is poison
I can only trust the untrustworthy.
